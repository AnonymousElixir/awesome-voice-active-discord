# Awesome Voice Active Discords
A curated list of awesome voice active Discord communities for programmers

## Why does this exist
While this is a nice [list...](https://github.com/mhxion/awesome-discord-communities) it doesn't have a seperate list for the servers with active voice chats.

It's alot more enjoyable to interact with other humans during learning, studying, and work then it is to just chat with chat only channels. Pleaase be respectful in these servers as there is no where near as many as their is in other communities, because many individials are introverted

I will keep a list of the most voice active servers as long as I'm active on discord, meaning the servers in this list have periods atleast every other month where atleast a few people join the voice channels and talk to one another about compuers and technology related topics and maybe get on every day. So if you know a server and would like to contribute, please make a pull.
